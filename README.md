## **How to Use**
For some reason, this repository is mostly written in markdown and python test scripts. For markdown, I simply suggest:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the markdown file in your favorite markdown viewer (I use VSCode, shamelessly).
    - For VSCode, "Ctrl+Shift+v" in markdown file will open the markdown preview. Preview will automatically render all the HTML and LaTex code of the markdown file.

I may find a better way to present these notes in the future. For now, this is messy but works for me.

## **What is this?**  
This is my personal scratchpad for playing with fundamental concepts across various topics. A dense mind needs a tangible place to write, code, and experiment with ideasâ€”so here we are.  

Topics and subtopics follow divergent-mind, curiosity-based order (a.k.a. a chaotic mess), early apologies for that.

Expect broken English, messy derivations, half-baked ideas, and code that sometimes works.  

## **Why does this exist?**  
1. I wanted a general playground.  
2. I believe that writing things down (even poorly) helps with understanding.  
3. Maybe someone else will find my struggles amusingâ€”or even helpful!  

## **Can I contribute?**  
Yes, please! If you find an error, have an insight, or just want to add some interesting perspectives, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Even if you just want to tell me Iâ€™m overcomplicating things, Iâ€™ll take that feedback too.  

Also, don't hesitate to suggest any topics we can explore together!  

## **Disclaimer**  
This repo **definitely** contains broken English, less-than-half-correct math, unconventional interpretations, and overcomplicated solutions to simple problems. Read at your own risk.
